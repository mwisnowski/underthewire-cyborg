seems to be base 64 due to use of upper and lower case characters, ending in two "==" and being 32 characters total, so let's store it first
PS C:\users\cyborg6\desktop> $a = Get-Content .\cypher.txt

PS C:\users\cyborg6\desktop> [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($a))
